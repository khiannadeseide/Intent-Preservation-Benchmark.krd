Intent Preservation Benchmark

Building open-source evaluation infrastructure that helps researchers determine when AI systems faithfully preserve human intent before deployment in high-stakes environments.**

Overview

As large language models become integrated into healthcare, government, finance, and other critical systems, evaluation has become just as important as capability. While modern benchmarks often measure whether a model produces the correct answer, fewer evaluate whether it faithfully preserves the original intent behind human instructions.

This project explores a different question:

How do we know when an AI system has preserved what a human actually meant?

The Intent Preservation Benchmark is an open-source research project that develops practical methods for identifying where large language models introduce omissions, unsupported assumptions, hallucinations, or subtle changes in meaning during complex information transfer.

Healthcare serves as the initial validation domain because it provides clear, measurable examples of high-stakes communication where preserving human intent is essential. The long-term goal is to develop evaluation methods that can eventually be adapted to other safety-critical domains.


Research Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an open-source benchmark and evaluation framework capable of measuring whether large language models faithfully preserve human intent when transforming complex information.

Rather than asking whether an AI response sounds reasonable, this project asks whether the model changed the meaning that the human originally intended to communicate.

Initial Benchmark

The current benchmark consists of twenty complex clinical discharge planning scenarios designed to evaluate how well language models preserve clinician intent during information transformation.

Each benchmark case includes:

Original clinical documentation
AI-generated output
Evaluation criteria
Intent preservation assessment
Documented failure patterns
Reliability scoring

The benchmark serves as the foundation for developing a larger open-source evaluation framework.


What Is Measure

Current evaluation categories include:

Information omission
Unsupported assumptions
Hallucinated clinical details
Medication inconsistencies
Changes in clinician intent
Logical reasoning failures
Overall intent preservation

These categories are intended to evolve as the benchmark expands.


Why This Matters

Large language models increasingly participate in workflows where preserving human intent is critical. Small changes in meaning can accumulate into larger downstream failures.

By developing standardized methods for measuring intent preservation, this project aims to contribute practical evaluation infrastructure that researchers can use to identify alignment failures before deployment rather than after real-world harm occurs.


Long-Term Vision

The long-term goal is to build open-source evaluation infrastructure for AI reliability.

Healthcare is the starting point because it provides measurable, safety-critical scenarios. The underlying methodology is intended to evolve into a reusable evaluation framework that researchers and developers can adapt to other high-stakes domains where preserving human intent is essential.
